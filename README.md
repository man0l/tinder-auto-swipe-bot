Using the Selenium module, tool that automates your social media
interactions with Swipe, Like and Dislike on Tinder implemented in Python.

### Installation

```elm
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Important**: depending on your system, make sure to use `pip3` and `python3` instead.

**Dependencies**

Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure it‚Äôs in your PATH, e. g., place it in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.

Failure to observe this step will give you an error selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: ‚Äògeckodriver‚Äô executable needs to be in PATH.

üíª **On Mac** you can install gekkodriver by running brew command - `brew install geckodriver`
